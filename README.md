Full Description of Project 4:

Design and Implementation of a Mobile-Based Archival and Retrieval of Missing Objects
Application using Image Matching
Introduction:
The loss or misplacement of personal belongings is a common occurrence that can cause
inconvenience and distress to individuals. Traditional methods of searching for missing objects,
such as posting flyers or contacting lost and found services, are often time-consuming and
ineffective. To address this issue, this project proposes the development of a Mobile-Based
Archival and Retrieval of Missing Objects Application using Image Matching.
This project aims to leverage mobile technology and image matching algorithms to create a robust
and user-friendly platform for archiving and retrieving missing objects. The mobile application
will allow users to capture images of lost items, store them in a centralized database, and perform
real-time image matching to identify potential matches.
Expected Outcomes:
▪ The project will result in the creation of a user-friendly mobile application designed to
facilitate the archival and retrieval of missing objects. The application will feature intuitive
interfaces and seamless navigation, making it easy for users to upload images of lost items
and search for potential matches.
▪ The application will incorporate state-of-the-art image matching algorithms to compare
uploaded images with a database of archived objects. Advanced computer vision
techniques, such as feature extraction and similarity scoring, will be employed to identify
potential matches with high accuracy and efficiency.
A centralized database will be implemented to store images and metadata of archived
objects, including descriptions, timestamps, and locations. The database will support
efficient indexing and retrieval of stored information, enabling users to access relevant data
quickly during the search process.
▪ The application will support real-time image matching and notification functionality,
alerting users when potential matches are found for their lost items. Users will receive
notifications via push notifications or email, allowing them to review and confirm potential
matches promptly.
▪ The application will leverage crowdsourcing and community engagement to enhance the
effectiveness of the search process. Users will have the option to share information about
their lost items on social media platforms, enlist the help of friends and family, and
collaborate with other users in the search for missing objects.
